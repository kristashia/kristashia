# Hi, Iâ€™m Kristashia!ðŸ‘‹

I am a multifaceted engineer exploring the overlap of full-stack development, front-end, UI/UX, Product Design, Artificial Intelligence, and immersive tech like AR/VR.

I build scalable, user-focused experiences with clean, thoughtful code balancing creative design with strong systems thinking. From interactive UIs to full-stack apps and experimental interfaces, I enjoy turning ideas into real, usable solutions.

Always designing. Always improving. Always learning.
